# SiriusUtils

This repo is meant to be a collection of some code I often use and want to have access to.

## Layout

Each proc has its tests written right below them. 
They can be called with 
```bash
nim c -d:test -r filename.nim
```

You can run all tests at once by compiling and running the siriusUtils.nim with the test flag:

```bash
nim c -d:test -r siriusUtils.nim
```

Or alternatively using Nimble:

```bash
nimble test
```

## Warning

Use at your own risk. Subject to change.
